#Epic to The Life of Marquita LeShe Snow Website
##**When the user enters the webpage, they will see a welcome marque and my logo about my life.**

##**I plan to have an enter button where they will be then guided from the homepage which displays my logo and my marquee to take them to my “About Me” tab.**

##**The About Me tab will display my biography plus a photo of me**

##**If my user clicks the photo it will take them to a video of a youtube video of me performing a poem.**
##**They should be able to click on the video which will be embedded in the photo on my site.**
##**They should not have to be taken to the YouTube website to view the video. **

##**If they scroll further on the website they will see the Social Media Playground which includes a GitHub, LinkedIn, Medium, Twitter, and Facebook logos.**
##**If they click any of these logos, the user will be taken to my profile page in which they will be able to follow me on the various social media outlet.**
##**Each page should launch a separate page on another tab.**

##**At the footer of the webpage, there is a feedback button which will launch a window for the user to issue feedback of my site and allow them to email me**

##**Below is the link to my Figma wire-frame of my website**
